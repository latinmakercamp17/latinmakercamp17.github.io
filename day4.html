  <h3>Arduino!</h3>
  <p>The Arduino is is a small, programmable microcontroller board. A microcontroller is a self-contained computer that serves a given purpose - like the computer chips that run your microwave or control the engine in your car. You don't directly interact with microcontrollers like you do with a regular computer, but you use them all the time, probably without even knowing it.</p>
  <p>We can program the chip on the Arduino board to send current to any one of the individual outputs - or "pins" on the board. By connecting a device such as an LED or a buzzer to a pin and supplying current to that pin, we can make light or noise.</p>
  <p>The Arduino is also capable of reading current on some of the pins. By reading the current coming from a light or temperature sensor, an Arduino can act as a automatic nightlight or thermostat.</p>
  <p>Today we will be looking at some of the basic principles behind circuit design and how we can use the Arduino to control those circuits!</p>

  <h3><a href="http://tinkercad.com/">Tinkercad!</a></h3>
    <p>Because making circuits is hard, we will be using a simulator to design our circuits and make sure they work as expected before building them in the real world. We will be using the Arduino simulator built into Tinkercad to do this!</p>
    <p>This is a brand new tool and we may run into some snags but it is MUCH easier than the old way of trial and error! The login information for Tinkercad is the same as before:</p>

    <h3>Circuit Project #1</h3>
    <p>Design a stoplight! Use red, yellow, and green LEDs to simulate how a stoplight cycles through its colors. Remember we can wire LEDs in series or parallel to light more than one off a given circuit!<p>
    </p>
    <h3>Circuit Project #2</h3>
    <p>Make a nightlight! Use the photoresistor included to tell the Arduino to make a light brighter or dimmer!</p>
