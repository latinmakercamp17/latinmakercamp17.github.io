<h3>Tea Light Programming</h3>
<p>The tea lights we are making use a tiny version of an Arduino board called the Trinket - it is much smaller than the Arduino we looked at earlier but has nearly all of the same functionality. We will be using the Trinket to control a NeoPixel - a special kind of easily programmable, multicolor LED. Using the Arduino as a controller, we can make the NeoPixel pulse, dim, or change colors in different patterns.</p>
<p>Although the board we are programming today looks very different from the board we were using yesterday, it works in more or less exactly the same way.</p>
